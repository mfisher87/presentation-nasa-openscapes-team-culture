# Presentation: "Team Culture" for NASA Openscapes 2024 Champions Cohort

I'll be administering the
[Team culture](https://openscapes.github.io/series/core-lessons/team-culture.html)
lesson for the 2024
[Champions Cohort](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/champions.html).

This repository is space I'm using to prepare, and my plan is for these contents to be
migrated/merged in to Openscapes lesson materis. I'm my personal GitHub right now
to better organize my thoughts.
