    * Excited about psychological safety because I've experienced both safe and unsafe
      environments and seen how drastically it can impact team health and outcomes. I
      want to move more personal experiences towards psychological safety.
    * I feel privileged to be teaching this lesson! I'm a beginner, but a lot of my work
      has been done for me; the content that follows was originally authored by Tara
      Robertson, a diversity, equity, and inclusion consultant who helped form this
      program, and based on foundational work by Dr. Amy Edmondson, Professor of
      Leadership at Harvard Business School.

## Overview

* **Diverse teams are more innovative** [@phillips_2014, Scientific American]

* **Psychological safety is critical**: People *must* feel like they can speak up and
  that their contributions are valued.

* **Actions you can take to boost psychological safety on your team**


:::{.notes}
* Research shows diverse teams are higher-performing, more profitable, and more
  innovative. Dr. Katherine Phillips' article "How Diversity Makes us Smarter" in
  Scientific American is a highly-recommended resource to learn more about this concept.
  _TODO: How to link this to psychological safety?_
* We're going to talk more about why psychological safety is critical, not just
  important, for effective teams, and what actions you can take to boost psychological
  safety on your team.

## What is psychological safety?

#### Amy Edmondson (Harvard Business School) says [-@edmondson_1999]...

> The shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal
> risk taking

> A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for
> speaking up

:::{.notes}
What is psychological safety?

A shared belief that I won't face punishment or humiliation by my peers for taking
interpersonal risks like pointing out mistakes, sharing a wild idea, or asking a
question I think may be perceived as "dumb".
:::


## What is psychological safety?

* It's not about avoiding conflict or being "nice"
* Do you feel safe to speak up with a concern or wildly creative idea? Or telling the
  presenter they forgot to share their screen?
* Examples: health care,

  science, data science

:::{.notes}
* Not about being "nice" or avoiding conflict, but being "honest" and "kind".
* A feeling that it's OK to speak up. Especially to those more senior or experienced or
  in a position of power.
* Have you ever felt like you saw a problem on the horizon? Did you feel safe raising
  that problem to a person above you who might be negatively impacted? 
* Issues with quality on Boeing aircraft have been in the news lately, and the link on
  this slide will take you to an article that points to poor psychological safety as a
  likely culprit.
* Health care: A nurse notices what looks like a dosage mistake, but isn't certain. Does
  he call an off-duty doctor and risk admonishment for interrupting a romantic dinner?
  If the doctor hasn't established an environment that is psychologically safe, maybe
  not.

_TODO: Original speaker notes below, but who is Michael? :) Adapt?_

<https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/what-is-psychological-safety-at-work/>

Share story about Michael when I messed up. “I don’t have line of sight on that” and
need you to let me know when there are issues. No blame, calm body language, clear
invitation to bring problems to him.

## It takes time and consistency to build trust

![@edmonson_2014_ted, TEDx talk](/assets/edmondson-avoidance-strategies.png)

:::{.notes}
It's natural, even instinctual, to avoid the negative emotions associated with looking
ignorant, incompetent, intrusive, or negative. But are those easy behaviors good for our
teams?

We want people to do the hard thing here, and that takes an investment in culture to
make the "hard but right" path look less dangerous.

## Psychological safety and accountability are not in conflict

![@edmonson_2014_ted, TEDx talk. The "learning zone" is when psychological safety and accountability are high.](/assets/edmondson-psych-safety-accountability-matrix.png){fig-alt="A matrix diagram defining 'Apathy Zone' when psychological safety and accountability are low, 'Anxiety Zone' when psychological safety is low and accountability is high, 'Comfort Zone' when psychological safety is high and accountability is low, and 'Learning Zone' when both are high."}

:::{.notes}
The concept of psychological safety can make some folks uncomfortable because they think
it's in **conflict with accountability** and that increasing psychological safety will
result in a **decrease in quality**.

Dr. Edmondson argues that **psychological safety and accountability are independent
variables**. She compares accountability to the gas pedal on a car, and lack of
psychological safety to the brake pedal.

I think it's a pretty common experience to feel uncomfortable speaking up in certain
environments. I can remember a time when I was in the "Anxiety zone": I had worked hard
in my free time to innovate on a widely-agreed-upon problem, but when I shared that work
at the office, I was challenged about working on the problem without approval. This left
me **unmotivated to continue a project that I was previously really jazzed about**.

Dr. Edmonson emphasizes that **the "Anxiety Zone" is the truly dangerous part of this
diagram**, with the potential for people to remain quiet even when they see disaster
looming. In the gas pedal / brake pedal analogy, this is pressing them both at the same
time.

You may currently be experiencing or have **positive memories of being in the "Learning
Zone"**, and perhaps it felt like the team had a "magic sauce" that enabled the team to
communicate freely, have fun, do their best work, and not feel intimidated or defensive.
This is a big payoff for a moderate investment!

In my earlier anecdote about receiving a negative reaction to sharing my independent
work, there's a happy ending. I re-shared that work in another community, and not only
received a supportive response, I gained a new friend and collaborator on that project
and more! (:wave: Sunny, if you're reading this)

## Assess {.smaller}

Use
[Amy Edmondson's 7-item questionnaire](https://www.uab.edu/reporter/resources/learning-development/item/8770-psychological-safety-is-the-secret-to-workplace-success):


1. If you make a mistake on your team, is it held against you?
1. Are you able to bring up problems and tough issues?
1. Do people on the team sometimes reject others for being different?
1. Is it safe to take a risk?
1. Is it difficult to ask other team members for help?
1. Do people on the team deliberately act to undermine your efforts?
1. Are your unique skills and talents valued and utilized?

You can ask these questions of yourself or your team to assess qualitatively where you are at with psychological safety.

The rest of these tips are from Amy Edmondson's 2014 TED talk.

#### How [Gavin Fay](https://twitter.com/gavin_fay) makes a psychologically safe space

From his [2022 NOAA seminar](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c624mH3md8pQHiP6rJ7HPuhxDLgNB7xvONDZlUM3f64/edit#slide=id.gb6050dd30d_0_0) Q&A:

* Live coding with his lab, show mistakes
* Prioritize time to get to know each other & share interests
    * "What birds did you see this weekend?"
* Follow pedagogical approaches to onboarding more inclusively
    * Ex: [teaching R with the tidyverse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03510)
        * _TODO_: Why is this a good example?

_TODO_: This story?

> On June 23, 2019, a landslide in a remote and rugged canyon along the Fraser River,
> north of Lillooet, was reported to the B.C. government. Over 85,000 cubic metres of rock
> had sheared off a 125-metre-high cliff and fallen into the river. These huge pieces of
> rock created a five-metre waterfall, which trapped migrating salmon below the slide.

## Overcompensate for tone [-@balter_2014]

Don't :roll_eyes: yet!

Text communication lacks tone. Emojis == professional! 

. . .

> We need to talk!

. . .

> :star_struck: We need to talk!


:::{.notes}
* There's controversy int the research here, as this is hard to study. Some research
  seems to show, and I think many feel intuitively, that the words we use are only a
  small part of the equation of deriving meaning from others.
    * The "7-38-55 rule": Albert Mehrabian (meh-RAY-bee-uhn): 7% words, 38% tone, 55%
      body language.
    * https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.2044-8260.1970.tb00668.x
* From "15 rules for communicating at GitHub", "Overcompensate for tone" has been the
  most useful lesson for me for modern online work communication.
* "We need to talk": Nobody wants to hear this.
* ":star_struck: We need to talk": While the words may still be a poor choice, this has
  become less scary.
