## What is psychological safety?

#### Amy Edmondson (Harvard Business School) says...

> The shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal
> risk taking

> A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for
> speaking up

## What is psychological safety?

* It's not about avoiding conflict or being "nice"
* Do you feel safe to speak up with a concern or wildly creative idea? Or telling the
  presenter they forgot to share their screen?
* Examples: health care, flight operations, science, data science
* It takes time and consistency to build trust

Share story about Michael when I messed up. “I don’t have line of sight on that” and
need you to let me know when there are issues. No blame, calm body language, clear
invitation to bring problems to him.

## Psychological safety and accountability are not in conflict

![@edmonson_2014_ted, TEDx talk. The "learning zone" is when psychological safety and accountability are high.](/assets/psych-safety-accountability-matrix.png){fig-alt="A matrix diagram defining 'Apathy Zone' when psychological safety and accountability are low, 'Anxiety Zone' when psychological safety is low and accountability is high, 'Comfort Zone' when psychological safety is high and accountability is low, and 'Learning Zone' when both are high."}


## Actions to boost psychological safety on your team {.smaller}

### Framing: Learning problem, _not_ an execution problem!

> What can we learn from this?

> We haven't been here before. We need everyone's brains and voices.

---

### Acknowledge your own fallibility

> What am I missing here?

> What haven't I considered?


### Model curiosity

Ask lots of questions!

#### How [Gavin Fay](https://twitter.com/gavin_fay) makes a psychologically safe space

From his [2022 NOAA seminar](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c624mH3md8pQHiP6rJ7HPuhxDLgNB7xvONDZlUM3f64/edit#slide=id.gb6050dd30d_0_0) Q&A:

* Live coding with his lab, show mistakes
* Prioritize time to get to know each other & share interests
    * "What birds did you see this weekend?"
* Follow pedagogical approaches to onboarding more inclusively
    * Ex: [teaching R with the tidyverse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03510)
        * _TODO_: Why is this a good example?

_TODO_: This speaker note

> On June 23, 2019, a landslide in a remote and rugged canyon along the Fraser River,
> north of Lillooet, was reported to the B.C. government. Over 85,000 cubic metres of rock
> had sheared off a 125-metre-high cliff and fallen into the river. These huge pieces of
> rock created a five-metre waterfall, which trapped migrating salmon below the slide.

> safe to speak up with a wildly creative idea or a problem that no one else saw?
