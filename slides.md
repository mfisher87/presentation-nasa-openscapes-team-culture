# What is psychological safety :question:

---

### Amy Edmondson (Harvard Business School) says [-@edmondson_1999]...

:::{.smaller}
_Emphasis added._
:::

> The shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal
> risk taking

<!-- alex ignore reject -->
> A sense of **confidence** that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for
> speaking up

:::{.notes}
What is psychological safety?

To me:

Feeling confident that I **won't face punishment or humiliation by my peers** for taking
interpersonal risks like **pointing out mistakes, sharing a wild idea, or asking a
question I think may be perceived as "dumb"**.
:::


## What is psychological safety?

* It's not about avoiding conflict or being "nice"
* Do you feel safe to speak up with a concern or wildly creative idea? Or telling the
  presenter they forgot to share their screen?
* Examples: health care,
  [aviation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/juliekratz/2024/03/27/the-boeing-leadership-shakeup-is-a-cautionary-tale-in-psychological-safety/?sh=270895f015a4),
  science, data science

:::{.notes}
* **Not about being "nice" or avoiding conflict, but being "honest" and "kind".**
* **A feeling that it's OK to speak up.** Especially to those more senior or experienced or
  in a position of power.
* Issues with quality on Boeing aircraft have been in the news lately, and the link on
  this slide will take you to an article that points to poor psychological safety as a
  likely culprit.
* Health care: A nurse notices what looks like a dosage mistake, but isn't certain. Do
  they call an off-duty doctor and risk admonishment for interrupting a romantic dinner?
  If the doctor hasn't established psychological safety, maybe the nurse administers the
  incorrect dose.

## It takes time and consistency to build trust

![@edmondson_2014_ted, TEDx talk](/assets/edmondson-avoidance-strategies.png)

**It's OK to repeat yourself!**

:::{.notes}
**It's natural to avoid the negative emotions** associated with looking ignorant,
incompetent, intrusive, or negative. But are those instinctual behaviors that come
naturally **good for our teams?**

We want people to do the hard thing here, and that takes an **investment in culture** to
make the "hard but right" path look less dangerous.

It's important to not be afraid to repeat yourself. Remind people there are no "dumb"
questions, that you acknowledge and want to hear about your own mistakes.
:::


## Psychological safety and accountability are not in conflict

![@edmondson_2014_ted, TEDx talk. The "learning zone" is when psychological safety and accountability are high.](/assets/edmondson-psych-safety-accountability-matrix.png){fig-alt="A matrix diagram defining 'Apathy Zone' when psychological safety and accountability are low, 'Anxiety Zone' when psychological safety is low and accountability is high, 'Comfort Zone' when psychological safety is high and accountability is low, and 'Learning Zone' when both are high."}

:::{.notes}
The concept of psychological safety can make some folks uncomfortable because they think
it's in **conflict with accountability** and that increasing psychological safety will
result in a **decrease in quality**.

<!-- alex disable he-she -->
Dr. Edmondson argues that **psychological safety and accountability are independent
variables**. She compares accountability to the gas pedal on a car, and lack of
psychological safety to the brake pedal.
<!-- alex enable he-she -->

I think it's a pretty common experience to feel uncomfortable speaking up in certain
environments. I can remember a time when I was in the "Anxiety zone": I had worked hard
in my free time to innovate on a widely-agreed-upon problem, but when I shared that work
at the office, I was confronted about working on the problem without approval. This left
me **unmotivated to continue a project that I was previously really jazzed about**.

Dr. Edmonson emphasizes that **the "Anxiety Zone" is the truly dangerous part of this
diagram**, with the potential for people to remain quiet even when they see disaster
looming. In the gas pedal / brake pedal analogy, this is pressing them both at the same
time.

You may currently be experiencing or have **positive memories of being in the "Learning
Zone"**, and perhaps it felt like the team had a "magic sauce" that enabled the team to
communicate freely, have fun, do their best work, and not feel intimidated or defensive.
This is a big payoff for a moderate investment!

In my earlier anecdote about receiving a negative reaction to sharing my independent
work, there's a happy ending. I re-shared that work in another community, and not only
received a supportive response, I gained a new friend and collaborator on that project
and more! (:wave: Sunny, if you're reading this)

1. Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues.
1. People on this team sometimes accept others for being different.
1. It is safe to take a risk on this team.
1. It isn‚Äôt difficult to ask other members of this team for help.
1. No one on this team would deliberately act in a way that undermines my efforts.
1. Working with members of this team, my unique skills and talents are valued and utilized.

## More tips from Amy @edmondson_2014_ted

<!-- alex ignore execution -->
* Framing work as a learning problem, _not_ an execution problem!

. . .

* Acknowledge your own fallibility

. . .

* Model curiosity
    * [20 great open-ended questions](https://wherewithall.com/resources/20-Great-Open-Questions.pdf)

:::{.notes}
### Framing as learning

> What can we learn from this?

> We haven't been here before. We need everyone's brains and voices.


### Acknowledge fallibility

Ask yourself:

> What am I missing here?

> What haven't I considered?


### Model curiosity

Ask lots of questions!

## Overcompensate for tone [-@balter_2014]

> :star_struck: We need to talk!


:::{.notes}
* From "15 rules for communicating at GitHub", **"Overcompensate for tone" has been the
  most useful lesson for me for modern online work communication.**
* Text communication lacks tone. **Emojis and/or other media are important elements of
  quality professional communication!**
* _Advance_
* **Is this how you feel?** Yet I think most feel intuitively that the words we use are
  only a small part of understanding each other.
* There is research supporting this, but its real-world applicability may be
  controversial.
    * The "7-38-55 rule": Albert Mehrabian (meh-RAY-bee-uhn): 7% words, 38% tone, 55%
      body language.
    * VERY small (n=20) study may indicate the brain processes emoticons similarly to
      faces: https://doi.org/10.1080/17470919.2013.873737
* _Advance_
* "We need to talk": **When I read this my heart beats faster.** Imagine someone saying
  these words to you in person, and how their facial expression, tone, and body
  language can change the perception.
* _Advance_
* ":star_struck: We need to talk": While the words are still a poor choice, this has
  become less scary.
* Emojis used to make me cringe until I worked on a team with a couple folks who were
  deeply steeped in "meme culture" and with some other folks who communicated very
  "dryly" by text. Over time, it became clear to me that people who used media in their
  text communication were more successful communicators than those who didn't.

#### How [Gavin Fay](https://twitter.com/gavin_fay) makes a psychologically safe space

From Gavin's [2022 NOAA seminar](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c624mH3md8pQHiP6rJ7HPuhxDLgNB7xvONDZlUM3f64/edit#slide=id.gb6050dd30d_0_0) Q&A:

* Live coding, show mistakes
* Prioritize time to get to know each other & share interests
    * "What birds did you see this weekend?"
* Follow pedagogical approaches to onboarding more inclusively
    * Ex: [teaching R with the tidyverse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03510)
        * _TODO_: Why is this a good example?

_TODO_: This story?

> On June 23, 2019, a landslide in a remote and rugged canyon along the Fraser River,
> north of Lillooet, was reported to the B.C. government. Over 85,000 cubic metres of rock
> had sheared off a 125-metre-high cliff and fallen into the river. These huge pieces of
> rock created a five-metre waterfall, which trapped migrating salmon below the slide.

## TODO

* Leslie Miley - the Ketchup Test: <https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/76h54l>
    * Add as a reference, add a dedicated slide?
<!-- alex ignore he-she -->
* In Amy's TED talk she mentions this towards the 10 minute mark IIRC, in emphasizing
  that this is critical for teams dealing with complexity and interdependency (i.e. most
  science work) but a mere cherry on top for teams that don't have those challenges._
